    <br><h1>Lisbon</h1><br>

      <p>On the final day of our trip to Europe, we spent our entire day in the city of Lisbon. Lisbon is the capital of Portugal, with a population of 504,718. Lisbon was a vibrant place, with street art and trams lining the city. The morning was spent on a walking tour of the city, where we were able to view ancient arcetexture being intermingled with modern artistic expression. There were multiple occasions where we were able to view the trams as they were passing by. We found that we were being led to an incline where we would learn that we were going to be viewing one of the most beautiful sights in Lisbon.</p><br><br>

      <p>Once we reached the top of the incline, we found ourselves at the top of a large balcony overlooking a sea of homes with red roofs and a beautiful church in the distance. This sight was absolutely spectacular and left everyone in our group in awe. After marvelling for a couple of minutes at the gorgeous sight before me, I got my partner and I to get a picture together in front of the balcony, along with one of each of us alone. His mother would eventually ask me to send the photo taken that day to her, which she then posted on Facebook to celebrate his birthday online. After we had our photos taken, we just leaned on the balcony and took in the beautiful scenery until we were informed that we would need to return to the bus to be transported to a different part of the city.</p><br><br>

      <p>After our brief bus ride, we were allotted ten minutes to view the Torre de Belem, which was a defence tower built in the 16th century by the water. The Torre de Belem was a gorgeous piece of architecture. This was not a notion that my well-travelled friend took kindly to. He stated to me that after all he has seen, manmade structures no longer impress him and that he had seen six other riverside castles, so this would make number seven. This comment made me somewhat consider pushing my friend into the water below, as I was quite annoyed with him. I refrained from doing so because I worried that he would hit his head during the fall.</p><br><br>

      <p>By the time I finished considering the logistical consequences of shoving my friend into the water below, we found out that our time viewing the tower was up and that we needed to return to the bus. From there, we were brought to another part of the city. Here, we were given 15 minutes to view the Padrao dos Descobrimentos, a monument located near the shoreline where Portuguese explorers departed to travel to India. The monument was gorgeous and had intricate designs on each of its surfaces. Unfortunately, we were unable to view the monument side-on as there were too many gypsies on each side of the monument attempting to accost tourists.</p><br><br>

      <p>After our time viewing the Padrao dos Descobrimentos was up, we were told to return to the bus. From here, we were placed in the shopping centre of the city, where we were informed that we would be given the next two hours to explore the city. Though we had been travelling in a large group up to this point, my partner and I departed from the rest of the group as they wanted to spend their time shopping while we did not. For the next hour, my partner and I walked across every square inch of the city that we could in the specific area we were placed in. During this time, we were able to find the Santa Justa Lift and the Supremo Tribunal de Justica. Though the city was gorgeous, we eventually admitted to each other that we were both starting to miss home and the people there. To combat this ever-growing feeling, we went into a shop and bought a family-size bag of Cheesies to share. We sat down on a ledge for an hour and watched a man sell what we later learned were called'splatty pigs'. For the hour, we enjoyed our cheesies together while watching a Portuguese man scream at tourists while splatting rubber pigs onto a piece of board. When the two hours were close to concluding, we took a walk down to look at the coastline for a couple of minutes. When we returned to reunite with our group, we found that the man was gone.</p><br><br>

      <p>After joining our group, we were taken to a restaurant, where we enjoyed our final meal in Portugal. Though the meal was simple, it was a nice meal to end on. After everyone had finished their meals, we made the walk back to our bus in the night. By this time, the buildings were illuminated with yellow lighting, and it was at this point in the night that the sky appeared to be a light purple colour. The sight of the illuminated city was a gorgeous one to end it on, as it felt magical. We returned to the hotel, where people were having fun spending time with each other during our final moments in this beautiful country. We all went to sleep early as we prepared for our trip back to Newfoundland.</p><br><br>
