          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>I am Robin, the creator of this website. The decision for the creation of this specific type of interactive website was born from viewing the profiles of those who used the page MySpace before the platform saw its decline. I was amazed by the fact that they allowed their users to alter the source of the server to personalize their pages. This was able to introduce a generation of youth to the world of web design and inspire some of them to pursue a career in software development. As a person who is interested in pursuing a career in software development and has been accepted into university to do a computer science major, I would have loved the opportunity to practice my skills with HTML and CSS in a way that would have been so accessible. I wanted to create this website as a way of displaying the knowledge that I currently possess when it comes to programming prior to receiving formalized education on the subject. Though it may not appear as the most refined-looking of websites, I wanted to display my starting point as a software developer with a major project. This passion project for English 3201 gave me the motivation to begin this project, as it would allow me to exercise self-discipline and would motivate me to consistently work on the program. I also wanted to encapsulate my current interests in this website as a way to be able to have a way for myself in the future to see what was considered important to me at the time that I created the website. Though it may be a bit rudimentary-looking, I hope you enjoy the project I put so much love and hard work into.</p>
