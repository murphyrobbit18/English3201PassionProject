            The Forbidden was a short story released in 1986 in the fifth volume of Clive Barker's anthology series, 'The Books of Blood'. This specific piece piqued my interest as it was the source material for the film 'Candyman'. Barker's writing is a breath of fresh air in the modern era, offering eloquently an written analysis of human nature. The short story begins with our main character, Helen Buchanan, working on her thesis on graffiti in a rundown set of council estates. Buchanan accidentally discovers there is something more than normal about the stories told in this place. The locals tell stories about gruesome murders committed by someone with a hook. Helen gets caught up in a true tale of horror when the Candyman reveals himself to her. </p>
