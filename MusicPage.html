      <br>As a child, my music taste was shaped by what I would hear in the car with my father. This is to say that I consumed a steady diet of alternative metal artists such as Korn, Rammstein, and Rob Zombie over the duration of my youth. Exposure to these boisterous vocalists and complex instrumentals would influence the music that I would seek out in my early adolescence. During my early teenage years, I was able to find bands such as My Chemical Romance, which I swiftly grew fond of. I found that they possessed the same instrumentals and theatrics that I desired in my music. Despite the similarities between them and their predecessors, their music seemed to emotionally resonate with their audience. In interviews, My Chemical Romance's lead singer, Gerard Way, displayed himself as a mild-mannered man who perpetrated the idea that those in their audience should strive to live authentically. This is a message that many of their audience members needed to hear, as many of them may have faced ridicule for living unapologetically as themselves.<br></p>

      I would spend my holidays listening to My Chemical Romance at every opportunity, giving their music a sentimental value that it would not have had otherwise. For the past couple of years, I have listened to their music while decorating the Christmas tree with my mother, which allows me to recollect these experiences whenever I listen to their music. I was also able to make connections to multiple pieces of literature through their song, 'To the End'. The song is based on the 1930 short story 'A Rose for Emily', which I read shortly after listening to 'To the End'. The plot revolved around a woman who fell in love with a man who did not reciprocate her feelings, as he is a homosexual. In retaliation, she decides to poison him and keeps his corpse in her house until it is discovered after her own death. I also read the novel 'The Shining' when I first listened to the song. I was able to find a connection between the treatment of the two LGBTQ+ characters in each of the books. In 'The Shining', there was a plot where a gay man fell in love with a bisexual man who only used him for his body on a singular occasion. Despite them becoming estranged, the man still finds himself in love with the man who used him. In a sequence that shows the events of a previous party, we see that the gay man was willing to humiliate himself by dressing up in a dog costume in front of a group of people in hopes of gaining the attention of the man he still loved. As a person who enjoys reading,I was fond of the fact that My Chemical Romance's music was able to connect me to new pieces of literature while also reminding me of pieces that I have already read.<br></p>

      <br><br>In early September of 2022, I had the opportunity to see My Chemical Romance in concert in Montreal. Being able to travel to another province to see a band that I had admired for multiple years was an unforgettable experience that I will cherish for the rest of my life. It felt unreal that I was able to see the on-stage antics of Gerard Way that I had only seen in videos beforehand. Relaying the events of the concert and the things said in between songs is still peculiar to myself, as I find it strange that I was able to hear these members of a band that I admire speak in the same vicinity as me.<br><br><br></p>

      The days spent in Montreal after the concert made me fall in love with traveling. Prior to making the trip out to see the concert, I felt wrong about going to a group of people's place of living and using it for my own entertainment. After having the ability to see the art museums and holy places of Montreal, I found appeal in being able to experience another culture. I attribute this trip to Montreal as being a reason for wanting to go on the Spain and Portugal EF Tour held by the staff of O'Donel, which I signed up for four months before the trip took place. In the latter half of my teenage years, my father's taste in music once again influenced my own as I started to listen to the rock band Ghost. This was after hearing him play one of their songs. My own pursuit of finding music allowed me to reignite my love of nu metal by listening to Korn. From there, I was able to find similar artists such as Slipknot and Static-X, who were able to remind me of the songs I enjoyed so much in my youth.<br></p>

    The music that I have listened to has had the ability to strengthen my connections with those I care about, as well as expand my world. The songs that I have listened to have been able to interweave themselves into my cherished memories, creating a powerful connection between myself and them.
