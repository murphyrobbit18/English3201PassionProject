        <p class="p1">To preface this analysis, Lolita is not on my list of favourite literature due to the content of the story. The instances of abuse in this novel are nothing short of horrific; they exemplify the monstrous nature of the character. I personally find this novel interesting as it offers insight into the psychological state of the predatory main character, Humbert Humbert, and how he is able to justify his actions to himself. The novel was written by Vladimir Nabokov and released in 1955. Nabokov was inspired by the abduction of Florence Sally Horner, which occurred in June of 1948. Horner was kidnapped by Frank Le Salle, a serial child molester who kept her captive for 21 months. During this time, Sally was repeatedly assaulted. Unfortunately, the novel was misinterpreted by the general public as a romantic narrative between a precocious young girl and a man trying to restrain himself. This interpretation can often discredit survivors of abuse, as they are the ones seen as the instigators of their abuse. A brief summary of the novel is that a man by the name of Humbert Humbert marries a widow with a 12-year-old daughter that he calls Lolita. A while into their marriage, the mother perishes in a car crash, leaving him as the person in primary care of her daughter, Dolores. In this new role, Humbert Humbert decides to drive across America for a year with Dolores, completely uprooting their lives and depriving Dolores of an education. During this year, he sexually assaults the twelve-year-old numerous times.</p>
