    <p>In late December of 2022, I took the very last opportunity I could to sign up to go on an EF tour to Spain and Portugal that would be held by a staff member at my school. When I first heard of the opportunity, I felt guilty about the idea of asking my parents if I could go to a foreign country. After a couple of months of the trip not leaving my mind, I decided that I wouldn't want to miss this chance to travel to Europe. I told my parents that I would like to seize this opportunity, to which they agreed. I emailed the coordinator of the trip, who informed me that this was the final day that I saw the message would be the final day I would be able to sign up, on the condition that I paid the full price that day. After informing my mother of the news, she told me she wanted me to contribute a couple hundred dollars to the trip, to which I happily obliged.<br></p>

    <p>Preparations for the trip were not as overbearing as I thought they would be. As my passport was still valid from the time that I was supposed to go to France and Italy in 2020, having my passport renewed was not a concern. At the point in which the trip was going to take place, there was no mandate in Spain or Portugal to have any specific vaccines outside of the ones mandated by the Canadian government. Despite this, my mother thought that it would be a good idea for me to get my influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations to boost my immune system if I were to be exposed to any unfamiliar strains of these diseases. Though I saw the importance of being immunized,my trypanophobia made it so that I reluctantly agreed to the decision.</p>

    <p><br><br><br>In the early morning of April 5th, 2023, my mother and I would say goodbye as I went on a plane bound for Pearson International Airport in Toronto with a couple of my closest friends to start our travels to Spain.</p>

    <p>Once we got to Pearson International Airport, we were informed that we would need to find a way to entertain ourselves for the next eight hours. Though we were aware that we would be staying in Toronto for eight hours, we were under the impression that we would be going on a tour of Toronto, though this plan was cancelled at the last minute. My friends and I would form a group with a couple of the girls who we would spend the rest of the trip with. For the next eight hours, we would explore the airport. We found it particularly entertaining to walk on the sidewalk. This is something we would do continuously for an hour and a half.</p>

    <p>After what felt like an eternity, we finally boarded the plane to get to Germany. By then, I was exhausted and spent the majority of our time at Frankfort airport asleep in my partner's lap. We were able to go outside for the first time in about a day since our travelling started for a couple of minutes in Germany, so I can technically say that I have been to Germany. Unfortunately, the weather was not great that day, so Germany felt quite reminiscent of our homeland. From there, we were able to get on the plane and have a short flight from Germany to Spain. After almost 30 hours of travel, we finally landed and made it to Madrid.</p>
