    <p>On day eight of the trip, we travelled to two different cities and two towns. Despite the fact that we were not there for long, the two towns that we visited displayed themselves as highlights of the trip. The first town that we visited was the historical Fatima. Fatima is a small town with a population of 13,000 that is known for a legend said to have happened within it. In the year 1917, three Portugese children alleged that the Virgin Mary had revealed herself to them. Our tour guide told us about the myth and the significance it had for their people. Though I am not a person with strong religious beliefs, I found it so intriguing that we were in the area where such a significant legend was born. After we were told the legend, we ended up having a tour of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima. This basilica was one of the most grand that we saw while in Portugal.<br><br></p>

    <p>After having completed the tour of the gorgeous building, we were able to go on a walk in a small park. There, our group found a piece of the Berlin Wall on display. When the Berlin Wall was destroyed, a large piece of the wall was bought by a Portugese emigrant who was living in Germany at the time and who donated to the Sanctuary in Fatima. The piece of the wall was put on display on August 13th, 1994. I was extremely excited to see this piece of history during our trip, though when I expressed this excitement to my well-travelled friend, he informed me that he had seen other pieces of the wall in museums before. As was common on the trip, I became mildly annoyed as my friend was unable to understand my excitement about seeing new things.<br><br></p>

    <img class="padding" src="./IMG/ModernChurch.JPG" alt="Fatima Modern Church" width="190" height="143">
    <p>While waiting for the bus, the tour guide told us that there was a modern church not far away that we could choose to look at. With the exception of my partner and me, no one else wanted to take a look at the church. We went inside the church but did not stay long as we were unsure as to when the bus was going to arrive to pick up the group. When we reunited with the group, my friend said that he "had already seen enough modern churches, so I didn't see a point in going in." It was at this point that I wanted to scream at my friend for being ungrateful for his opportunities to travel.<br><br></p>

    <p>After exploring Fatima, we went on the bus once again to reach our next destination, Batalha. Batalha is a small town with a population of 15,000 people that is mainly known for the Batalha Monastery, which holds the remains of the three shepherd children who claimed to see the Virgin Mary. When the bus stopped and I had the chance to see the monastery, it solidified itself as my favourite structure that I had seen on the entire trip. Everything, from the intricate details of the tombs to the paintings that lined the wall, captivated me. The short tour of the Batalha Monastery has solidified itself in my memory as one of the most beautiful sights of the trip and will be a memory I will cherish forever. After having been able to bear witness to the beauty of this structure, I had to depart from it as I got back onto the bus to go to the hotel in Lisbon.<br><br></p>
