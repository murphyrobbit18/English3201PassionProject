        <p>On the fifth day of our voyage, we parted from Madrid and headed to the small city of Aliva, a city bordered by a wall with a population of approximately 57,000. After receiving an hour-long walking tour where we were able to view the beautiful exterior of the city, we were allotted two free hours to roam the area. During our walking tour, we were informed that during our free time, we would have the opportunity to walk on the wall for a small fee. While most people decided to use their time to shop, me and a couple of other people grouped up with the goal of getting on the wall.</p>

        <p>Seeing as we had an abundance of time, we decided to use the bathroom and get something to eat. We ended up finding this gorgeous bakery in the heart of the city and asked if they had a bathroom. As the person did not speak English, this raised the anxiety of one of the members in my group, causing that specific person to make us leave. After we left the gorgeous bakery, I basically begged the person to go back into the bakery due to being hungry, they refused to go back in, stating that it would be rude to go back in after leaving. As an attempt to rectify the situation, the person attempted to use Google Maps to find a public bathroom despite them not being prominent in Spain. After going to the edge of the city, we found that Google Maps led us to a cave.</p>

        <p>After losing my mind at the person for once again refusing to go back into the bakery even though we had wasted an hour already, we decided to no longer use the bathroom and go to walk on the wall. When we went to pay for admission, we found that we would be unable to go on the wall unattended as we were all under the age of eighteen. It was my tenacity that ended up getting us on that wall. While the other people in my group accepted defeat, I put forth the plan of asking a Spanish person to go on the wall with them. The other people in my group were adverse to the idea, so we decided to enlist the help of our tour leader, Paula. She ended up doing the exact thing I suggested by asking a young Spanish couple if we could go on the wall with them, to which they agreed happily.</p>

        <p>After one person from our group bought a pin to commemorate our stay in this gorgeous city, we finally made it to the entrance to the wall. The views from the wall were absolutely breathtaking and made the petty complaints that I had throughout the day melt away. We were able to see the entire city that we spent the morning walking through from a brand new perspective. The couple that we went on the wall with was incredibly kind to us and took the photograph featured to the right. Their kindness helped to elevate the experience of this walk tremendously. Being able to have this beautiful walk with the people I was closest to on this tour was definitely a highlight of the trip that I would not have exchanged for any shop that the city had to offer. Once we departed from the couple, we thanked them in their native tongue as a small gesture of our gratitude.</p>

        <p>After reuniting with our group leader, she informed us that we needed to find a place to eat and use the bathroom quickly as we would be going on the bus for two hours without a break in the next ten minutes. This led me and my partner to a Spanish bar where we each purchased a small meal to eat. As we bought something at their establishment, we were allowed to use their bathroom which we did in turns. When my partner was in the bathroom, I accidentally broke a glass when attempting to move his backpack. This caused laughter amongst the people in the bar as I apologized to the bartender who was cleaning up the glass. After my partner left the bathroom, we left the bar to join our group once again. There, we went back on the bus to start our trip to Salamanca.</p><br><br>
