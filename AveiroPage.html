      <p class=short>On the sixth day of our trip, after a brief tour of Ciudad Rodrigo, we ended up driving into the country of Portugal. From there, the first city in Portugal that we stopped in was the lovely Aveiro. Aveiro is a city in Portugal with a population of about 80,000. Aveiro is often called the Portuguese Venice due to their beautiful gondola rides. We had a brief tour of the city, where we were able to see the gorgeous river that we learned we would be taking a gondola ride on later that day. After viewing the gorgeous exterior of the city, we were brought to a shopping centre, where we had an hour of free time to find a meal to eat.</p><br>

      <p class="short">While the vast majority of the group flocked to the stores that provided the most Canadian-looking processed food possible, my partner and I attempted to find a restaurant that would be different from what we would find at home. We ended up finding a steak house in the middle of the shopping centre. We decided that we would divide the cost by having one person pay for a meal and then the other buy a meal another day. We were surprised to find that the two steaks that were bought were worth a total of â‚¬19.95, which is approximately $29.34 in Canadian dollars. This meal was one of my favourites of the entire trip, as the steak also included a side of rice, fries, and sweet potato chips with an egg on top of the steak.</p><br>

      <p>After eating our delicious lunch, we were rushed out of the shopping centre so that we would not be late for our gondola tour. The tour from the water was absolutely breathtaking. Despite having seen the views only a few minutes prior, they seemed so much more special from the water. We had a funny tour guide on the water and were accompanied by a group of local people taking a tour of the city. I found it adorable when the small child on the gondola waved to Mr. Furey as we saw him on a bridge.</p>

      <p>After finishing our gondola tour, we were brought to different parts of the city. This area possessed a white sandy beach that was overlooked by a tall pink and white-striped lighthouse. While the majority of our group spent the day on the beach, my friends and I spent the rest of the day exploring the city. The city had a quiet beauty to it that was not as present in the boisterous cities in Spain. My friends and I were able to find an ice cream parlour where we had to resort to communicating with the owner of the shop using rudimentary gestures due to the language barrier. Although I felt embarrassed that I was unable to speak the language of the nation, I thought that the trouble was ultimately worth it to obtain the ice cream.</p><br>

      <p>After having spent the afternoon in the serene city of Aveiro, we were placed back on the bus, where we would be travelling to our hotel in Porto to prepare to spend the next day there. Though the latter half of our trip to Aveiro was spent independently exploring the city, I found what we had seen and done that day to be a very memorable part of the tour.</p>
