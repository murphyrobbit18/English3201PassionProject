            Inferno is the first of three parts of the epic poem Divine Comedy, written by Dante Alighieri and released in the early 14th century. The story begins with Dante getting lost in the woods. He intends to climb a mountain but encounters three wild beasts who threaten him; as he wonders what to do, Virgil, a Roman poet, appears. Starting on Good Friday, Virgil leads Dante into hell. On the shores of the river of the dead, Dante sees many people who are neither in heaven, hell, nor purgatory, including someone who was most probably a pope. Once in hell proper, Virgil guides Dante through the Nine Circles of Hell. Along the way, Dante will be threatened by various demons, but Beatrice has interceded for him in heaven, and his faith does not fail. He and Virgil escape at dawn.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
